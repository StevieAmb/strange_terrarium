        <h2>About Caroline Strange</h2>
        <p>
          Caroline Strange (they/she) is an award winning terrarium artist living in Philadelphia, PA. 
          While they began their artistic career in music and theater, they've been cultivating their 
          visual artistry through terrarium making. For Caroline, the unique perspective of combining 
          antique pieces with botanical art has inspired them to tell community stories and connect with
           nature, even in an urban setting. They also won ribbons at the 2025 Philadelphia Horticultural
            Society Flower Show, as well as being nominated as a Shining Star Volunteer for the same year. 
            They hold an MFA in Acting from UNC - Chapel Hill and a BA in Music Performance from Western 
            Connecticut State. Caroline Strange (they/she) is an award winning terrarium artist living
