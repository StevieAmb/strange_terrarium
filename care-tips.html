      <h2> Care Guides for Different Types of Terrariums</h2>
      <p>Terrariums are miniature ecosystems that can bring a touch of nature indoors, 
        but the care requirements for closed and open terrariums can differ significantly. 
        Here's a concise guide to help you maintain each type effectively.</p>

      <h3>Closed Terrariums</h3>

        <article class="ct-right-of-img">
          <h4>Environment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Humidity: Closed terrariums create a humid environment. The moisture from the soil and plants will condense on the walls and drip back down, making it self-sustaining.</li>
            <li>Light: Place in indirect light. Too much direct sunlight can overheat the closed space and cause the plants to fry.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Plants</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Species Selection: Choose humidity-loving plants such as ferns, mosses, or certain tropical species. Avoid succulents, as they prefer drier conditions.</li>
          </ul>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h4>Maintenance</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Watering: Typically, closed terrariums do not need watering for several weeks or even months. Check for condensation; if itâ€™s too foggy, it might be overwatered.</li>
            <li>Pruning: Keep plants pruned to prevent overcrowding and ensure air circulation.</li>
            <li>Cleaning: Occasionally, wipe the glass to remove condensation or algae buildup.</li>
          </ul>

      <h3>Open Terrariums</h3>
      <article>
        <h4>Environment</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Humidity: Open terrariums have more airflow and lower humidity levels, so they require different watering habits.</li>
          <li>Light: They thrive with more direct sunlight, but avoid prolonged exposure to harsh afternoon sun.</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article>
        <h4>Plants</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Species Selection: Opt for drought-tolerant plants like succulents, cacti, or air plants. 
            Be mindful to mix plants with similar light and water needs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Maintenance</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Watering: Water more frequently than closed terrariums, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. 
            Always check soil moisture before watering.</li>
          <li>Pruning: Regularly prune to maintain size and shape and to prevent the spread of mold.</li>
          <li>Cleaning: Dust off the plants and clean the container as needed to keep it looking fresh.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>General Tips for Both Types</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Positioning: Keep terrariums in a stable environment, away from drafts, heating vents, or extreme temperature changes.</li>
        <li>Fertilizing: Use diluted liquid fertilizer sparingly (every few months) for both types, being cautious with closed terrariums.</li>
        <li>Pest Management: Check for pests regularly and treat them promptly without harming your plants.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By understanding the unique needs of closed and open terrariums, you can create and maintain thriving, beautiful microcosms that enhance 
        your home. Happy planting!</p>
